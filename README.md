# HackerRank

This repository is my personal collection of solutions to the various
programming challenges on the website **HackerRank.com**. These solutions are not
official solutions and shouldn't be treated or used as such. This repository is
solely dedicated to showcasing my programming capabilities and style. In
addition, I use this repository as a resource for myself.

### Solutions

Solutions will be in their own folder with the name of the challenge as
described on the HackerRank website. The folder with contain a pdf file which
describes the challenge at the time it was completed on the website (challenges
occasionally are changed minimally). The folder will also contain an individual
file or files which are different (but complete) solutions. I completed some
challenges in multiple languages and/or with a different approach in the same
language.

For some of these solutions, an understanding of runtime and space
analysis/complexity is necessary to be considered a full solution. I have taken
this into account and so the solutions on this repository will only be full
solutions.

### What is HackerRank?

_"HackerRank is a site for hackers from all over the world to solve
programming problems in different CS domains like algorithms, machine
learning and artificial intelligence, and to excel in different programming
paradigms like functional programming."_ -- **HackerRank.com**
