This was the first time-limited contest i've done ever. It was quite intense and
I know now how to prepare better. I should also keep in mind that these Week of
Code contests put a large emphasis on runtime analysis, so when writing these
programs on the next week of code, I'll attempt to make each program as
efficient as possible.
